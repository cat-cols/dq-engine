    "Short version: treat your tools like a **real dependency**, not copy-paste clutter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few solid patterns, from easiest to more “engineered”:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. The simple but solid way: a “toolbox” repo you `pip install -e`\n",
    "\n",
    "**When:** You mostly use Python and you’re okay keeping your toolbox repo next to your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Setup once:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Put your reusable stuff in its own repo, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   tools-lib/\n",
    "     pyproject.toml  (or setup.py)\n",
    "     tools_lib/\n",
    "       __init__.py\n",
    "       io_helpers.py\n",
    "       eda_utils.py\n",
    "       ...\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Make it a package (basic `pyproject.toml` or `setup.py`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**In a new project:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "your-project/\n",
    "tools-lib/        # cloned next to it\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then in your project’s venv:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -e ../tools-lib\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from tools_lib.io_helpers import load_parquet_safely\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this is nice:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* You get **one canonical copy** of each tool.\n",
    "* Bug fixes in `tools-lib` automatically apply to all projects once you bump the version / reinstall.\n",
    "* `-e` (editable) means you can improve tools while working on any project.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Template repo / “starter kit” for new projects\n",
    "\n",
    "**When:** You want each new project to start with the same skeleton (structure + some tools), but tools can diverge per project.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a repo like `project-template/`:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   project-template/\n",
    "     src/\n",
    "       common_tools/\n",
    "         __init__.py\n",
    "         logging_setup.py\n",
    "         paths.py\n",
    "     config/\n",
    "     notebooks/\n",
    "     tests/\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When starting a new project, you either:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Click “Use this template” on GitHub **or**\n",
    "   * Copy the folder as your starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Refine / specialize tools directly inside the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good when:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* You care more about fast start than centralizing every utility.\n",
    "* Each project might tweak the tools heavily.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Git submodule / subtree: share code without a package manager\n",
    "\n",
    "**When:** Multiple repos, maybe multiple languages, but you still want a shared code folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submodule (more explicit, a bit fiddly)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the new project:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git submodule add https://github.com/you/tools-lib.git tools_lib\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Project tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "your-project/\n",
    "  tools_lib/   # read-only-ish copy from separate repo\n",
    "  src/\n",
    "  ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then import as a local module (e.g. with `src/tools_lib` on PYTHONPATH).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subtree (acts like you copied it, but can sync later)\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git subtree add --prefix tools_lib https://github.com/you/tools-lib.git main --squash\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You get the code as if it were part of your repo, and you *can* pull updates from the original.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. “Real dependency” with versioning (internal PyPI / package registry)\n",
    "\n",
    "**When:** You want this to feel like any third-party library.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Turn your toolbox repo into a proper package and version it: `tools-lib==0.3.0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Publish it to:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Private PyPI, Artifactory, or GitHub Packages **or**\n",
    "   * Install directly from Git:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     pip install \"git+https://github.com/you/tools-lib.git@v0.3.0\"\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Add to `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Clear versioning: project A might use `tools-lib==0.2.1`, project B `0.4.0`.\n",
    "* Updating tools is a standard “bump version → upgrade dependency” flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. What *not* to do (except as a quick hack)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Copy-pasting files** (`utils.py` copied into every project):\n",
    "\n",
    "  * You will lose track of which project has the “latest” fix.\n",
    "  * Bug fixes become whack-a-mole.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay as a one-off experiment, but not a long-term strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to decide (practical rule of thumb)\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you’re **still figuring out what belongs in the toolbox**\n",
    "  → Use **#1 editable toolbox repo** (fast to iterate, still centralized).\n",
    "\n",
    "* If a project needs a very custom flavor and you don’t care about reusing those changes\n",
    "  → Start from a **template repo** (#2) and edit locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Once some tools feel **stable and broadly useful**\n",
    "  → Promote them to a **versioned package** (#4).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you tell me what’s in your toolbox (Python utilities? SQL snippets? config helpers?), I can sketch a tiny layout + example imports tailored to how your Telco + EDGAR projects are structured.\n"

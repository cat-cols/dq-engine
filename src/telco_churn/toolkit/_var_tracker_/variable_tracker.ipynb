    "Excellent question — and one that even many experienced Jupyter users ask.\n",
    "Unfortunately, **Jupyter by itself doesn’t track where (which cell or line)** a variable was first created. But there are a few *practical workarounds* you can use to get that visibility 👇\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧭 **1. Track variable origins automatically (recommended trick)**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can wrap your notebook’s global namespace in a custom tracker.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add this **at the top of your notebook** (before imports):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# --- Variable origin tracker ---\n",
    "from IPython import get_ipython\n",
    "import inspect, linecache\n",
    "\n",
    "_created_vars = {}\n",

    "def trace_exec(frame, event, arg):\n",
    "    if event == \"call\": return trace_exec\n",

    "!grep -n \"target_cols\" 01_EDA.ipynb\n",

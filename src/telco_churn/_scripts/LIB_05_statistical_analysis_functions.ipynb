    "1.1 What Is Statistical Testing? (The Courtroom Analogy)\n",
    "Think of statistical testing like a courtroom trial:\n",
    "The Setup:\n",
    "Null Hypothesis (H₀): The defendant is innocent (nothing interesting is happening)\n",
    "Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): The defendant is guilty (something real is happening)\n",
    "Evidence: Your data\n",
    "Verdict: Based on probability, not certainty\n",
    "Significance Level (α): How much risk you're willing to take of convicting an innocent person\n",
    "Business Translation:\n",
    "Null Hypothesis: \"Contract type has NO effect on churn\"\n",
    "Alternative Hypothesis: \"Contract type DOES affect churn\"\n",
    "Evidence: Your churn rates across contract types\n",
    "Verdict: If p-value < 0.05, we reject the null (contract type matters!)\n",
    "\n",
    "1.2 The P-Value: Your Evidence Strength Meter\n",
    "What it means in plain English:\n",
    "\"If there was really no difference (null hypothesis is true), what's the probability I'd see results this extreme just by random chance?\"\n",
    "The Scale:\n",
    "p < 0.001: \"Extremely unlikely to be chance\" → Very strong evidence\n",
    "p < 0.01: \"Very unlikely to be chance\" → Strong evidence\n",
    "p < 0.05: \"Unlikely to be chance\" → Standard threshold (95% confident)\n",
    "p > 0.05: \"Could easily be chance\" → Not enough evidence\n",
    "Real-World Example:\n",
    "Churn Rate:\n",
    "- Month-to-month contracts: 42.7%\n",
    "- Annual contracts: 11.3%\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: Is this difference real or just random?\n",

    "Group B: [50, 52, 48, 51]    Average: 50.25\n",

    "Translation: \"This 20-month difference is definitely real, not random\"\n",
    "Business Action: Focus retention efforts on customers in first 18 months!\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions to Check:\n",
    "Independence: Each customer is separate (✓ in our data)\n",
    "Normality: Data follows bell curve (can test with Shapiro-Wilk)\n",
    "Equal variance: Both groups have similar spread (can test with Levene's test)\n",

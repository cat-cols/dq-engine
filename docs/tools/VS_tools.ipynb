    "**Cmd+Click on a variable** is basically your editor doing a best-effort “**go to definition**” hop. It’s useful because notebooks are chaotic little lava lamps of state, and this gives you a rope.\n",
    "\n",
    "What it’s doing (usually via the notebook UI’s language features / LSP):\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the variable/function/class is **defined in the same notebook**, it jumps you to the cell (or line) where it was last defined.\n",
    "* If it’s **imported from a module**, it tries to open the module source (or at least show you where it lives).\n",
    "* If it can’t find anything, it just… shrugs silently (the notebook equivalent of “I looked around”).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why it’s useful:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Trace the origin of a name** fast: “Where did `sec2_27_dir` get set?” → jump.\n",
    "* **Understand scope & overwrites**: notebooks let you redefine stuff repeatedly; this helps detect “oh, I redefined `df_clean` 20 minutes ago.”\n",
    "* **Debug weird state issues**: when your current cell errors because some variable isn’t what you think, jump to where it was assigned.\n",
    "* **Navigate long notebooks** without searching and losing your place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important caveats (because notebooks are gremlins):\n",
    "\n",
    "* It can be **wrong** if you redefined the variable later and the indexer is stale.\n",
    "* It’s often **static-analysis based** (it analyzes code text), so dynamic assignments like `globals()[name] = ...` or names created inside loops can confuse it.\n",
    "* For Python builtins / compiled libs, it may not show source.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mental model:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cmd+Click is **map navigation**, not the territory.\n",
    "* The real territory is: *what’s currently in memory right now*.\n",
    "\n",
    "A practical pairing:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use Cmd+Click to jump to where it’s defined.\n",
    "* Then confirm reality with:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `type(var)`\n",
    "  * `var is None`\n",
    "  * `getattr(var, \"empty\", False)`\n",
    "  * `dir(var)` if you’re poking objects\n",
    "\n",
    "That combo is basically “static hint + runtime truth,” which is the notebook survival kit.\n"

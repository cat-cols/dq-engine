    "### Project Root (`PROJECT_ROOT`)\n",
    "- **Definition:** Canonical root directory of the Telco churn repository.\n",
    "- **Purpose:** All other project paths (configs, data, resources, notebooks) are resolved relative to this directory.\n",
    "- **Resolution Rule:** Discovered by walking up from the current working directory until a folder named `Telco` is found (or, in future, a folder containing `config/project_config.yaml`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Level Name (`LEVEL_NAME`)\n",
    "- **Definition:** String label that identifies the current “skill level” subproject within the Telco repository (e.g., `\"Level_3\"`).\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Allows multiple levels (`Level_0` … `Level_12`) to coexist in a single repo while keeping their configs, notebooks, and resources separated.\n",
    "- **Typical Values:** `\"Level_0\"`, `\"Level_1\"`, `\"Level_2\"`, `\"Level_3\"`, etc.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Level Root (`LEVEL_ROOT`)\n",
    "- **Definition:** Root directory for the current level’s code and resources.\n",
    "- **Path Contract:** `LEVEL_ROOT = PROJECT_ROOT / LEVEL_NAME`\n",
    "- **Purpose:** All level-specific paths (e.g., `config/`, `resources/reports/`, `resources/artifacts/`) are resolved relative to this directory, not directly from `PROJECT_ROOT`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Current Path (`CURRENT_PATH`)\n",
    "- **Definition:** Absolute path to the current working directory of the running notebook or process.\n",
    "- **Implementation:** `CURRENT_PATH = Path.cwd().resolve()`\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Used only as a starting point to **discover** `PROJECT_ROOT` and `LEVEL_ROOT`. It is *not* used directly in config; once `PROJECT_ROOT` is resolved, all paths are derived from it.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to go one step further, you could add:\n",
    "\n",
    "```md\n",
    "> **Path Resolution Invariant:**\n",
    "> Runtime code should not hard-code absolute paths. \n",
    "> All paths must be derived from `PROJECT_ROOT` and `LEVEL_ROOT` via config (e.g., `PATHS.*`).\n",

    "1. **Be specific** – “FIXME: this is bad” is useless; say *what’s* wrong.\n",
    "2. **Optional ticket link** – if you use issues, add the ID like `FIXME(TELCO-42)`.\n",

    "## How they’re used in practice\n",

    "* IDEs and tools can **search for `FIXME`** (and `TODO`) so you get a quick list of known issues.\n",
    "* Some teams fail CI if `FIXME` is present in main branches.\n",
    "* It’s often used as a **temporary safety beacon**: “ship this for now, but don’t forget this behavior is not final.”\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## In your project specifically\n",
    "\n",
    "Good `FIXME` candidates:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Path heuristics you *know* you’ll replace with proper config/env overrides:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  # FIXME: allow PROJECT_ROOT override via TELCO_PROJECT_ROOT env var\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "* Places where you know behavior isn’t fully correct yet (e.g., missing edge cases in DQ checks, brittle assumptions about Telco schema).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’d like, I can scan a few of your current sections (1.2, 1.4, 1.5) conceptually and suggest **exact** `FIXME` vs `TODO` comments for the spots that are “temporary hack” vs “future nice-to-have.”\n",

    "The most important data type change required for numerical operations is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`TotalCharges`**: Must be changed from **Object** (string) to **float64**. This is necessary because the column represents a continuous numerical value but contains non-numeric entries (usually single spaces) that force the initial Pandas Dtype to be `Object`.\n",

    "---\n",
    "why not switch them to category dtype\n",
    "That's a great question about data efficiency!\n",
    "\n",
    "You're right that many of the **Object** (string) columns in the Telco Churn dataset **should** be treated as categorical features. However, for the purpose of modeling, they are rarely kept as the basic Pandas `category` dtype when feeding them into most machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why you convert the object columns to **numeric** (integers/floats) or use an **encoded** representation instead of just switching the Pandas dtype to `category`:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🤖 Modeling Requirement: Algorithms Need Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Most machine learning models (like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Neural Networks) are built on **mathematical operations**. They can only process features that are represented numerically.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Binary Columns (Yes/No):**\n",
    "    * **Why not `category`?** While a Pandas `category` is memory-efficient, the model needs to distinguish between the two states numerically.\n",
    "    * **Action:** We use **Binary Encoding** (e.g., mapping 'Yes' to **1** and 'No' to **0**), which converts the column to an **`int64`** or **`uint8`** type. This is the simplest and most direct way to represent a binary choice mathematically.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Multi-Category Columns (e.g., `InternetService`):**\n",
    "    * **Why not `category`?** If you convert 'Fiber optic', 'DSL', and 'No' directly to a Pandas `category`, the model still can't use it. You can't perform math on text labels.\n",
    "    * **Action:** We use **One-Hot Encoding** (creating new binary columns for each category) or **Label Encoding** (assigning an integer like 1, 2, 3) to convert the information into numerical format. The resulting columns are typically **`int64`** or **`float64`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💾 When `category` Dtype is Appropriate\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pandas `category` dtype is extremely valuable in the **data preparation and exploration** phase, especially when dealing with very large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Memory Efficiency:** Switching from a string/Object dtype to `category` significantly reduces memory usage if the column has a low number of unique values (low cardinality) but many rows.\n",
    "* **Faster Operations:** Grouping and sorting operations can often be faster with a `category` dtype than with an `Object` dtype.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In short:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* You **can** and **often should** switch the Pandas dtype to `category` during initial data cleaning for performance and memory optimization.\n",
    "* But, you **must** convert the final features to a **numeric (int/float)** representation *before* passing them to most machine learning models.\n",

    "## 🐍 **Python `config.py` - What I Recommended**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Advantages:**\n",
    "- **Native Python**: No additional parsing libraries needed\n",
    "- **Type Safety**: Python objects with built-in validation\n",
    "- **Dynamic Configuration**: Can include logic, calculations, or conditional settings\n",
    "- **IDE Support**: Full autocomplete, syntax highlighting, and error checking\n",
    "- **Complex Data Structures**: Easy to define nested dictionaries, lists, classes\n",
    "- **Documentation**: Docstrings and comments work naturally\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# config.py\n",
    "from pathlib import Path\n",
    "\n",
    "# Dynamic path resolution\n",
    "BASE_DIR = Path(__file__).parent.parent\n",

    "## 🤔 **When to Choose Which?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Use Python `config.py` when:**\n",
    "- **Learning/Development** (like your Level 3) - easier to work with\n",
    "- **Complex logic needed** in configuration\n",
    "- **Type safety important**\n",
    "- **Small team/solo project**\n",
    "- **Configuration changes infrequently**\n",

    "- **Configuration changes frequently**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 **My Recommendation for Your Level 3:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stick with `config.py` for now**, here's why:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Learning Focus**: You're learning Python - keep everything in Python\n",
    "2. **Simplicity**: One less dependency (`pyyaml`)\n",
    "3. **IDE Benefits**: Better development experience\n",
    "4. **Natural Progression**: You'll evolve to YAML in Level 10+ (DevOps)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 **Evolution Path:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Level 3-6: config.py (learning, development)\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "Level 7-9: config.py + environment variables\n",
    "    ↓  \n",
    "Level 10+: config.yaml + environment-specific configs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 **Best of Both Worlds (Level 9+):**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can actually use both:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# config.py\n",
    "import yaml\n",
    "from pathlib import Path\n",
    "\n",
    "def load_config(config_path='configs/config.yaml'):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Load configuration from YAML file.\"\"\"\n",

    "        return yaml.safe_load(f)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use it\n",
    "CONFIG = load_config()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 **Quick Comparison:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Factor | config.py | config.yaml |\n",
    "|--------|-----------|-------------|\n",
    "| Learning curve | ✅ Easy | ⚠️ Need to learn YAML |\n",
    "| IDE support | ✅ Full | ⚠️ Limited |\n",

    "| Production ready | ⚠️ Code mixing | ✅ Clean separation |\n",
    "| External tool friendly | ❌ Python only | ✅ Universal |\n",
    "\n",

    "### Holism (the philosophy)\n",
    "- Core idea: “The whole is more than the sum of its parts” (phrase usually traced to Aristotle, popularized in the 20th century by Jan Smuts in his 1926 book Holism and Evolution).\n",
    "- Opposite of **reductionism** (the belief that you can fully understand something by breaking it down to its smallest pieces and studying them in isolation).\n",
    "- Holistic view says: properties and behavior of the whole system can **emerge** from the interactions of parts in ways that you cannot predict just by looking at the parts separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- A human being is not just a bag of cells; consciousness, behavior, and health emerge from interactions.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Systems thinking (the applied version of holism)\n",
    "Systems thinking is basically **holism turned into a toolkit** for real-world problem solving. It became popular in the 1950s–1990s through people like Ludwig von Bertalanffy (General Systems Theory), Jay Forrester (System Dynamics), Peter Senge (The Fifth Discipline), Donella Meadows, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key principles of systems thinking (all straight from holism):\n",
    "1. Focus on the **whole system** and its purpose, not just individual components.\n",
    "2. Look for **interconnections, feedback loops, and relationships** between parts.\n",
    "3. Recognize **emergent properties** — things the system does that none of the parts do on their own.\n",

    "| Real-world example in data | “My SQL query is slow” → optimize that one query | “Why do we keep getting bad data downstream?” → map the entire pipeline, feedback loops, incentives, and contracts between teams |\n",
    "\n",
    "### In your data quality engine context\n",
    "You’re already practicing systems thinking / holism without realizing it:\n",
    "- Reductionist approach → write 50 separate validation scripts, run them independently, fix each error as it pops up.\n",
    "- Holistic / systems-thinking approach (what you’re doing) → build one engine that understands table dependencies, upstream/downstream impact, rule inheritance, alerting feedback loops, and how a single bad column can break ten dashboards. That’s exactly why Uber and Netflix invest in centralized data quality platforms instead of scattered Great Expectations scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "So yes — holism is the philosophical foundation, and systems thinking is the engineering and problem-solving methodology that grew out of it. When recruiters at mature data companies see a candidate who instinctively thinks this way (e.g., “I built a data quality engine instead of 100 one-off checks”), they immediately flag you as someone who will scale well beyond junior-level tasks.\n",

    "\n",
    "In addition to traditional data quality checks (schema, nullability, ranges, domain rules, and business logic), this project implements a **full entropy-based statistical monitoring layer**. Entropy provides a mathematically rigorous measure of uncertainty within numeric and categorical distributions, allowing the pipeline to detect subtle, emergent, or unexpected changes in the underlying behavior of the dataset that rule-based systems cannot capture.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is especially important in churn modeling, where small shifts in customer behavior (e.g., monthly charges, tenure patterns, contract preferences, add-on services) can indicate early signals of changing business dynamics or upstream data issues. Rule-based validation alone cannot reliably capture these shifts. By integrating **Shannon entropy**, **normalized entropy**, and **Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD)** as drift metrics, the pipeline can quantify how stable or volatile each distribution is relative to historical baselines.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is a **cross-column, model-agnostic health score** called the *Entropy Score*, which rolls up numeric entropy, categorical entropy, and categorical drift into a single interpretable stability metric. This score feeds directly into Section 2’s **Integrity Index**, providing an at-a-glance indicator of dataset stability across runs. These entropy and drift metrics are logged as structured JSON artifacts, enabling time-series monitoring, alerting, and future compatibility with ML model retraining triggers.\n",

    "* Silent failures where the data “looks valid” but is semantically wrong\n",

    "## **2.3.x Entropy-Based Statistical Integrity Module**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Purpose**\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2.3.x Entropy Module computes distribution-level stability metrics for all numeric and categorical columns using Shannon Entropy and related divergences. Its purpose is to detect subtle changes in data behavior—including upstream process shifts, silent failures, or evolving customer patterns—that are not detectable through schema or rule-based validation alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Scope**\n",
    "\n",
    "This module runs after basic numeric profiling (2.3.x) and before categorical integrity checks (2.4). It computes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Normalized Shannon Entropy** for numeric and categorical distributions\n",
    "* **Per-column drift** via **Jensen–Shannon Divergence (JSD)**\n",
    "* **Rank percentiles** for entropy values across features\n",
    "* **Stability bands** (Excellent/Good/Warning/Critical) derived from thresholds defined in CONFIG\n",
    "* **Aggregated metrics** including numeric entropy mean, categorical entropy mean, and JSD mean\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Outputs**\n",
    "\n",
    "The module writes structured artifacts to the Section 2 reports directory, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `numeric_profile_df.csv` with entropy-normalized fields\n",
    "* `categorical_profile_df.csv` with entropy + JSD drift values\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Non-Goals**\n",
    "\n",
    "This module does not enforce business rules or domain-specific constraints; it focuses exclusively on statistical patterns and behavioral signals. Business logic enforcement remains within Sections 2.4.x and 2.5.\n",

    "\n",
    "The entropy component measures statistical uncertainty and behavioral stability across all features using Shannon Entropy for numeric/categorical columns and Jensen–Shannon Divergence (JSD) for temporal drift. These metrics quantify how predictable or volatile each distribution is relative to historical baselines. High entropy may reflect increased randomness or noise, while unusually low entropy can indicate data collapse, missing variation, or silent upstream failures. By aggregating mean entropy and average drift scores into a single normalized **Entropy Score**, the Integrity Index captures early indicators of data instability that rule-based checks cannot detect, providing a statistically grounded signal of whether the dataset remains reliable for analysis and modeling.\n",

    "\n",
    "In information theory, **entropy = uncertainty + disorder in data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In data engineering, entropy basically measures:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. How unpredictable your data is**\n",
    "\n",
    "High entropy → more randomness\n",
    "Low entropy → more structure, more predictable patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. How “messy” or “noisy” the data is**\n",
    "\n",
    "High entropy datasets = lots of missing values, inconsistent formats, chaotic categories, drifting distributions\n",
    "Low entropy datasets = consistent schema, stable categoricals, well-behaved numeric distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. How costly it is to compress, store, validate, or process**\n",
    "\n",
    "Entropy directly relates to compression, indexing efficiency, and processing times.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# **🧠 Why Entropy Is Important in Data Engineering**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. It tells you how stable your pipelines will be**\n",
    "\n",
    "High-entropy inputs → more schema drift, temporal drift, mode collapse, weird categories popping in, numeric outliers, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Low-entropy inputs → easier to enforce your rules in Section 2.1–2.6.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is basically the backbone of your **Data Quality Score / Integrity Index**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "ML models *hate* high entropy unless it reflects real signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sudden spike in rare categories? → category entropy rise → model instability\n",
    "* Sudden flattening of a numeric distribution? → entropy drop → potential outage or bug\n",

    "* **data contracts**\n",

    "## **3. It determines how compressible and cost-efficient your data is**\n",
    "\n",
    "High entropy = random data → poor compression → higher storage costs\n",
    "Low entropy = predictable → great compression → lower cost\n",

    "## **4. It reveals data health before you even do deep profiling**\n",
    "\n",
    "High entropy is often a *first warning* that something upstream changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example in your Telco dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `TotalCharges` suddenly shows a uniform distribution\n",
    "* The categorical `Contract` suddenly has extra junk labels\n",

    "\n",
    "## 🤖 Modeling Requirement: Algorithms Need Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Most machine learning models (like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Neural Networks) are built on **mathematical operations**. They can only process features that are represented numerically.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Binary Columns (Yes/No):**\n",
    "    * **Why not `category`?** While a Pandas `category` is memory-efficient, the model needs to distinguish between the two states numerically.\n",
    "    * **Action:** We use **Binary Encoding** (e.g., mapping 'Yes' to **1** and 'No' to **0**), which converts the column to an **`int64`** or **`uint8`** type. This is the simplest and most direct way to represent a binary choice mathematically.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Multi-Category Columns (e.g., `InternetService`):**\n",
    "    * **Why not `category`?** If you convert 'Fiber optic', 'DSL', and 'No' directly to a Pandas `category`, the model still can't use it. You can't perform math on text labels.\n",
    "    * **Action:** We use **One-Hot Encoding** (creating new binary columns for each category) or **Label Encoding** (assigning an integer like 1, 2, 3) to convert the information into numerical format. The resulting columns are typically **`int64`** or **`float64`**.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Memory Efficiency:** Switching from a string/Object dtype to `category` significantly reduces memory usage if the column has a low number of unique values (low cardinality) but many rows.\n",

    "### **Advantages:**\n",
    "- **Native Python**: No additional parsing libraries needed\n",
    "- **Type Safety**: Python objects with built-in validation\n",
    "- **Dynamic Configuration**: Can include logic, calculations, or conditional settings\n",
    "- **IDE Support**: Full autocomplete, syntax highlighting, and error checking\n",
    "- **Complex Data Structures**: Easy to define nested dictionaries, lists, classes\n",
    "- **Documentation**: Docstrings and comments work naturally\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# config.py\n",
    "from pathlib import Path\n",
    "\n",
    "# Dynamic path resolution\n",
    "BASE_DIR = Path(__file__).parent.parent\n",

    "### **Use Python `config.py` when:**\n",
    "- **Learning/Development** (like your Level 3) - easier to work with\n",
    "- **Complex logic needed** in configuration\n",
    "- **Type safety important**\n",

    "\n",
    "**Stick with `config.py` for now**, here's why:\n",

    "1. **Learning Focus**: You're learning Python - keep everything in Python\n",
    "2. **Simplicity**: One less dependency (`pyyaml`)\n",

should I put the coercion_log in runs/<RUN_ID>/reports/2_2/

Yes — **that’s a clean, professional move** *if* you’re standardizing “reports by section.”

My rule of thumb:

* **Run-scoped + debug/traceability artifacts** → go under `runs/<RUN_ID>/reports/...`
* **Canonical contracts / inputs reused across runs** → go under `resources/` (or `artifacts/` outside runs)

`coercion_log.csv` is **run-scoped** by nature because:

* it depends on the exact raw input and parsing behavior that run,
* you may toggle `APPLY_COERCION`,
* and it’s basically an audit trail.

So placing it at:

`runs/<RUN_ID>/reports/2_2/coercion_log.csv`

is totally sane.

### Suggested convention (tight + scalable)

For 2.2 assets:

* `runs/<RUN_ID>/reports/2_2/type_detection_summary.csv`
* `runs/<RUN_ID>/reports/2_2/column_type_map.json`
* `runs/<RUN_ID>/reports/2_2/coercion_log.csv`

Then your downstream sections read from the same “section folder,” not a “topic folder.”

### One caution (important)

`column_type_map.json` is often a **bridge artifact** used by multiple later sections (2.3, 2.4, etc.). If you bury it under `2_2/`, that’s fine, but be consistent: downstream should always look there.

If you *also* want a “latest stable pointer,” do this pattern:

* write the real file to run scope:
  `runs/<RUN_ID>/reports/2_2/column_type_map.json`
* optionally copy/sync to:
  `resources/artifacts/latest/column_type_map.json`
  (or `_latest/column_type_map.json`) so later steps can “consume latest” without hardcoding run IDs.

But for **coercion_log.csv specifically**: I’d keep it **only run-scoped**.

💡💡 If you adopt `reports/<section>/` folders, you can delete a ton of variables like `TYPE_DET_DIR` and just have `SEC2_22_DIR`, `SEC2_23_DIR`, etc.

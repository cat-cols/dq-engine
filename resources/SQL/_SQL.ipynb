    "### 3 clean ways to add CTE SQL to your project\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1) Save CTE queries as `.sql` files in a dedicated folder (recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "Add something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `resources/sql/section2/`\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `2_5_structural_integrity.sql`\n",
    "  * `2_4_model_readiness.sql`\n",
    "  * `common_ctes.sql`\n",
    "\n",
    "Then your notebook can do:\n",
    "\n",
    "* read SQL text from file\n",
    "* parameterize it (dates, table names)\n",
    "* run it (BigQuery / DuckDB / Postgres)\n",
    "* save results to your existing `SEC2_*_DIR` outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "This keeps the SQL version-controlled and not buried in notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2) Keep CTE SQL in your CONFIG (good for small queries)\n",
    "\n",
    "Add a config key like `SQL.QUERIES.<name>` and load it with your `C()` helper. Great for short queries, but big multi-CTE queries get hard to read inside YAML/JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3) Generate “derived tables” with CTEs and materialize them\n",
    "\n",
    "Use CTEs to build “clean” or “model-ready” datasets and write them into:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `PROCESSED_DIR` (CSV/parquet)\n",
    "* or a database schema (e.g., `analytics.section2_*`)\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s basically the SQL analog of your Python artifact pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where it plugs into *your* pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "Given your structure, I’d add:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `SQL_DIR = PROJECT_ROOT / \"resources\" / \"sql\"` (or `SEC2_DIR.parent / \"sql\"` if no project root)\n",
    "* `SQL_SECTION2_DIR = SQL_DIR / \"section2\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "and treat SQL files as **inputs** and query results as **artifacts** saved under `SEC2_2X_DIR` / `NUMERIC_DIR` / `CATEGORICAL_DIR`.\n",

    "Perfect. The clean portfolio move is: **one SQL “contract” + three isolated runners** (BigQuery / DuckDB / Postgres), all producing the *same artifacts* so you can prove portability + engineering discipline.\n",

Project: Telco Customer Churn Prediction
Level: 3 - Baseline Model with Modular Code
Date: 2025-09-23

DATA SUMMARY:
- Total samples: 7,043
- Features: 22
- Target: Binary (Churn: Yes/No)
- Class distribution: {0: 0.7346467873624423, 1: 0.2653532126375577}

MODEL ARCHITECTURE:
- Preprocessing: StandardScaler + OneHotEncoder
- Algorithm: Logistic Regression
- Pipeline: Sklearn Pipeline with preprocessing

PERFORMANCE METRICS:
- Accuracy:  0.802
- Precision: 0.661
- Recall:    0.521
- F1-Score:  0.583
- ROC-AUC:   0.842

KEY INSIGHTS:
1. Model achieves 0.842 ROC-AUC, indicating good discrimination
2. Recall of 0.521 means we catch ~52% of actual churners
3. Top churn indicators: Contract type, Payment method, Tenure

CODE IMPROVEMENTS (Level 3 Achievement):
✓ Extracted repetitive code into reusable functions
✓ Created telco_analysis package with modular structure
✓ Implemented complete sklearn pipeline
✓ Established reproducible workflow

NEXT STEPS (Level 4):
- Feature selection and engineering optimization
- Cross-validation for robust evaluation
- Model comparison (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Hyperparameter tuning
